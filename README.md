# Statical-Hypothesis-Testings-with-Python

I use different types of statical testing. I use the following:

-Chi-square test:  The Chi-square test of independence tests if there is a significant relationship between two categorical variables

Hypothesis:

H0: The null hypothesis again represents the "no change" or "no difference" situation.
H1: =  H0 is false.

If the p-value is significant, you can reject the null hypothesis and claim that the findings support the alternative hypothesis. ( The p-value is p < 0.05 show that H0 is false generally)
