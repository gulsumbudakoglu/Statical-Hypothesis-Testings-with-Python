# Statical-Hypothesis-Testings-with-Python

I use different types of statical testing. I use the following:

1.Chi-square test:  The Chi-square test of independence tests if there is a significant relationship between two categorical variables

Hypothesis:

H0: The null hypothesis again represents the "no change" or "no difference" situation.
H1: =  H0 is false.

If the p-value is significant, you can reject the null hypothesis and claim that the findings support the alternative hypothesis. ( The p-value is p < 0.05 show that H0 is false generally)

2.T-test: if we have samples which are having unequal sample sizes so we can use t-test is a nonparametric univariate test that tests for a significant difference between the mean of two unrelated groups. It is an alternative to the independent t-test when there is a violation in the assumption of equality of variances.  The t-test is a statistical test that is used to compare the means of two groups. It is often used in hypothesis testing to determine whether a process or treatment actually has an effect on the population of interest, or whether two groups are different from one another.

Hypothesis:

The null hypothesis (H0) is that the true difference between these group means is zero.
The alternate hypothesis (Ha) is that the true difference is different from zero.
